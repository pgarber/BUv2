# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application
Phil Garber

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

views from divshot:
homepage.html went into users/homepage.html.erb
myfeedback went into users/show.html.erb
landing.html went into shared/_landing.html.erb
leaderboard.html went into users/leaderboard.html (should it be a partial?)
try to do better design with shared/_signed_in_scaffold.html.erb
